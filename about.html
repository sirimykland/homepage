					  <p>I am a 23-year-old computer science student from Kristiansand, Norway. I am starting on my master's degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) this fall. Before starting at NTNU, I went to the University of Stavanger and got my bachelor's degree in engineering. During those three years, I spent one semester abroad at San Diego State University in California.</p>
                      <p>I began my education at the University of Stavanger in the fall of 2016 and graduated in the spring of 2019. During those years fell in love with coding and being a student. During my time there, I learned all sorts of languages such as Java, Python, MATLAB, Javascript, SQL, CSS, HTML, and some other languages. I was a teacher assistant in DAT100 (Object Oriented Programming in Java).</p>
                      <p>During my first year in Stavanger, I became a part of the student organization for CS students and learned a whole lot about working in groups and creating inclusive environments. The organization, called LED, gave me the opportunity to participate at events such as Evry's IT-Galla and a variety of company visits.</p>
                      <p>The highlight of my time at UiS was the student trip to Silicon Valley, arranged by LED in the spring of 2017. We visited NASA's visitors center, Google campus, and the Intel Museum and many other places in the Valley. Also, we went on a company visit to Aruba which ended at Levi's Stadium. During the stadium tour, we learned about how Aruba delivered high-speed internet to 75'000 people during the 2016 Super bowl. The trip to was a cool experience, that I will cherish forever.</p>
                      <p>I decided to go abroad during my 5th semester at San Diego State University. During my stay, I was introduced to and learned languages such as Ada, C, C++, Lisp, Python, Perl, Racket and FORTRAN 90/95. Some might question the relevance of these languages, and trust me I did too. However, I quickly realized that the skill I developed was learning how to learn a new programming language, which is a very relevant skill to have as a programmer. I know for a fact that during my stay in San Diego, I evolved academically, linguistic and socially by meeting new inspirational professors, fellow students, and friends. The experience is something I will keep for the rest of my life.</p>
                      <p>I have always been fascinated with the concept of virtual reality, and for my bachelor thesis, I got to develop and write about the process of developing a VR game. The project was assigned to us by the University and had its purpose of promoting the university to High School students visiting the university. The game was developed in Unity using C#, in which I had no prior experience nor knowledge. The process was both fun and educational for me, and I feel that the project was a valuable experience, because the process of developing a product for a client is very relevant for future employment.</p>
                      <p>During the summer of 2019, I had a summer internship at Systek AS. Systek is a Norwegian IT consulting company, that offers services within system development, architecture, project management, and testing. The internship was six weeks long and was kicked off by a 3-day-visit to NDC, which is a big conference for developers in Oslo Spectrum with people from all over the world.</p>
                      <p>During the five remaining weeks, me and two other students were assigned a new project at the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten), who is one of Systek's biggest clients. What I liked about working at the Norwegian Tax Administration was that they are very assertive in their choices of new technology. The project assigned to us was to make a web application for internal use that would be integrated into their pre-existing systems. We chose to use React and Springboot as these were both widely used in their existing systems. Some of the technologies that we used were Jenkins, Docker, and Openshift.</p>
                      <p>Thanks to our very talented mentors, I gained a lot of new experience with frontend and backend development. I am really glad I moved to Oslo to do the internship at Systek. I now have an understanding of what the future holds for myself as a developer.</p>
                      <p>Though I have not yet chosen a specific major at NTNU, I am excited about exploring the different paths the University has to offer. The experience I have from my time as a student only takes me halfway. For that reason, I am looking for a job where I can use the new and old experience to work with real projects.</p>
                      <p>On this page I will try to post my projects, however, this page is hosted by Github pages, and therefore the type of content may be limited.</p>
                      <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> 4th year student at NTNU, who loves to code</p>
